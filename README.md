This repository serves as the public-facing counterpart to our private repository for MuSpAn. While the core development happens in a private repository, this public space is designed to foster community engagement, track issues, and host open discussions. To stay updated, any announcements and updates to the project can be found at www.muspan.co.uk



## Purpose of This Repository

In this repository you can:
- Report Issues: Share bugs, feature requests, or other concerns for us to address.
- Discuss Ideas: Engage in open discussions about the project’s goals, implementation, or potential applications.

## How to Get Involved 
We value community contributions and welcome your input. Here’s how you can participate:

1. Open an Issue: Use the Issues tab to report problems or suggest new features.
2. Join the Discussion: Share your thoughts or questions in the Discussions tab or on our [Gitter community channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#muspan-community:gitter.im).


## A Note on Contributions
Since this repository is primarily for issue tracking and discussion, we are not accepting direct code contributions here. If you have ideas for code changes, please open an issue or start a discussion—we’d love to hear your input!

## Thank You!
Thank you for your interest in MuSpAn! Your feedback and participation are invaluable as we work together to make this project a success.
