Tutorials
=========

A solid understanding of MuSpAn is crucial to fully leveraging its capabilities in spatial data analysis.
To build a good foundational understanding of MuSpAn, we recommend starting with the Getting Started and Queries tutorial sets. 
Beyond this, each tutorial is largely self-contained, so you can dive into specific topics independently as needed. 
This flexible approach ensures you can learn at your own pace while focusing on the areas most relevant to your project.

While the MuSpAn tutorials are presented within the context of cellular biology, the methods and tools are broadly applicable to any form of spatial data. 
We hope these examples not only guide you through the software but also spark ideas for using MuSpAn in your own research—whatever your field may be!

.. note::
     MuSpAn is a broad framework for spatial analysis and these tutorials only cover a small subset of the available functionality. 
     We're working hard to expand the tutorial collection, so if you have a specific topic in mind that you'd like to see covered, `please let us know! <https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#muspan-community:gitter.im>`_
